# Fun with Noise
Playing with Perlin and Simplex noise in the browser. The code leverages
https://github.com/josephg/noisejs and liberally uses the provided samples.

## Fuzzy
[fuzzy.html](http://hessmer.org/generative/fun-with-noise/fuzzy.html) produces fuzzy lines using Perlin noise as a field to guide the trajectory of particles.

## Islands
[perlin-islands.html](http://hessmer.org/generative/fun-with-noise/perlin-islands.html) simply uses the noise value to determine the color of a pixel.

## Waves
[threejswaves.html](http://hessmer.org/generative/fun-with-noise/threejswaves.html) uses the noise value to calculate the height in a 3d representation.
